      Hi! This is the friendly automated conda-forge-linting service.
      
      I just wanted to let you know that I linted all conda-recipes in your PR (```recipe/recipe.yaml```) and found it was in an excellent condition.
      
      
      I do have some suggestions for making it better though...
      
      
      For **recipe/recipe.yaml**:
      
      This is a rattler-build recipe and not yet lintable. We are working on it!
